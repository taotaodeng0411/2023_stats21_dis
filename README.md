Have a file uploader button which allows you to upload your own csv file

Once the csv file has been uploaded display relevant statistics about the dataset, such as: number of rows, number of columns, how many categorical/numerical/bool variables are there (other information you can think of, optional)

An appropriate input widget to select a single column from the dataset. (If you are a looking for a challenge select multiple columns, optional)

Once the chosen column has been selected, if the column is numerical display in a table the five number summary, create a distribution plot using matplotlib/seaborn. The plot should be highly customized, I recommend The Python Graph Gallery for examples and inspiration

If the column selected is categorical, display in a table the proportions of each category level, and create a customized barplot
